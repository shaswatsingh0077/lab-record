# Experiment 4: Shell Programming (Bash)

## 📝 Aim
To write and execute shell scripts using *Bash* for performing simple programming tasks.

---

## 🛠 Apparatus / Requirements
- Linux operating system (Ubuntu/Fedora/WSL etc.)  
- Bash shell (/bin/bash)  
- Text editor (e.g., nano, gedit, vim)  

---

## 📖 Theory
- *Shell scripting* is used to automate tasks by writing commands in a script file.  
- A Bash script begins with **shebang (#!/bin/bash)** to specify the interpreter.  
- It supports *variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, and functions*.

## 🔬 Procedure
1. Open a terminal in Linux.  
2. Create a new file, e.g., nano script.sh.  
3. Write the shell program and save the file.  
4. Give execution permission:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
