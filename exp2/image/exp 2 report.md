## 1. Theory: Understanding Linux File Systems
Linux uses a hierarchical file system structure:  
- Root directory `/`  
- Subdirectories like `/home`, `/etc`, `/usr`, `/var`  
- Everything in Linux is treated as a **file**, including devices.  
- **Absolute paths** start from `/`; **relative paths** start from the current directory.

## 2. File Permissions
Linux file permissions control access to files and directories:  
- **Permission types**:  
  - `r` â€“ Read  
  - `w` â€“ Write  
  - `x` â€“ Execute  
- **Permission classes**:  
  - `u` â€“ User (owner)  
  - `g` â€“ Group  
  - `o` â€“ Others  
- **View permissions**:  
  ```bash
  ls -l
  Bash 
  chmod 755 filename
  chmod u+x filename
  chown user:group filename
